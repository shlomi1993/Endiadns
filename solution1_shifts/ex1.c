/*******************************************************************************
* Solution for question 1.

                If it's equal to 1, than the system is a little endian.

* Solution for question 2.
* Input:        Two unsigned longs.
* Output:       Combined unsigned long as the question request.
* Operation:    This function creates a new number by taking x and shift it
                halfway to the right and then back to its original position
                while insert zeros to the right. Afterwards, it creates another
                number by taking y and shift it halfway to the left and then
                back to the original position. Then return the sum of the two
                new numbers. Because of mathematical features, it doesnâ€™t
                matter what system the program run on.

* Solution for question 3.
* Input:        Unsigned long, unsigned char and an int.
* Output:       Unsigned long with replaced byte as the question demands.
* Operation:    Like the previous solution, this function uses shifts to create
                new numbers. But this time it creates 3 new numbers: right is
                created by shifting (i+1)*length to the left and then back to
                normal, left is created by shifting (length - i)*length to the
                right and then back to normal and middle is created by taking b
                and shift it to its correct position according to I. Finally,
                the function sums the three and return.
